# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

The Game of Life is an imaginary robot game (cellular automaton) made by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The Rules of game is simple -

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
